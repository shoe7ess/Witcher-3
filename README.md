Witcher 3 Always Full Exp Neovalen Reversion Reforged Merge

So I went ahead and took some time to create a migration for the "Always Neovalen Exp" option from Always Full Exp and coded in your DLC fix while keeping the Neovalen Expï»¿ modifiers:
Difficulty Steps multiplied by the full experience the quest would have granted (100% Easy/Normal, 90% Hard, 80% Deathmarch)
Grey Quest: 50% Experience
I also added in the npc.ws script from this mod to the Always Full Exp (Always Neovalen Exp Edition). As far as I could tell the files were identical except for how they calculated experience, but if this .7z is added through the Witcher 3 mod manager it shows up as the normal "Full Neovalen Exp (GOTY" in the mod list (even though the mod folder shows modFullNeovalenExpReforgedJ).
